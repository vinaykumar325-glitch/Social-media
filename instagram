Instagram icon from 2016 to 2022, when it was updated to include even more saturated colors
Instagram began development in San Francisco as Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 (equivalent to $682,200 in 2023) seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn.[10][11] Realizing that it was too similar to Foursquare, they refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among its users.[12][13] They renamed it Instagram, a portmanteau of instant camera and telegram.[14]

2010–2011: Beginnings and major funding
Josh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager,[15] Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer,[15] and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011.[15][16]

The first Instagram post was a photo of South Beach Harbor at Pier 38, posted by Mike Krieger at 5:26 p.m. on July 16, 2010.[17][13] On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App Store. In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million (equivalent to $9,357,057 in 2023) in Series A funding from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo.[18] The deal valued Instagram at around $20 million. In April 2012, Instagram raised $50 million (equivalent to $65,610,000 in 2023) from venture capitalists with a valuation of $500 million (equivalent to $656,100,000 in 2023).[19] Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's Series B fundraising round, leading his investment firm, Thrive Capital, to double its money after the sale to Facebook.[20]

2012–2014: Additional platforms and acquisition by Facebook
On April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones,[21][22] and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day.[23] The Android app has since received two significant updates: first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of the app by half and added performance improvements;[24][25] then in April 2017, to add an offline mode that allows users to view and interact with content without an Internet connection. At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users were located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at its announcement, Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline, and that they were "exploring an iOS version". On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms) bought Instagram for $1 billion (equivalent to $1,312,000,000 in 2023) in cash and stock,[26][27][28] with a plan to keep the company independently managed.[29][30][31] Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012,[32] and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed.[33] On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook officially closed with a purchase price of $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock.[34]

The deal closed just before Facebook's scheduled initial public offering according to CNN.[31] The deal price was compared to the $35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005.[31] Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was "committed to building and growing Instagram independently."[31] According to Wired, the deal netted Systrom $400 million.[35]

In November 2012, Instagram launched website profiles, allowing anyone to see user feeds from a web browser with limited functionality,[36] as well as a selection of badges, and web widget buttons to link to profiles.[37]

Since the app's launch it had used the Foursquare API technology to provide named location tagging. In March 2014, Instagram started to test and switch the technology to use Facebook Places.
